      <h1>Character Dating</h1>
      <h2>Which character best fits your personality?</h2>
      <h3>You've tried other dating websites, many based on mutual likes and interests, even mutually disliked things or interest! Character Dating offers something more, kind of like horoscope dating, but by creating a profile with a character archetype and matching you based on what characters other users select.
